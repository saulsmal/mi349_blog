           <h2>The Benefits of Music</h2>
           <h5>posted by Malyk Sauls (Oct. 11, 2020)</h5>
           <p><img src="music.jpg" alt="a collection of music Malyk listen"></p>
           <p> Jean-Michel Basquiat once said <em>Art is how we decorate space and Music is how we decorate time.</em> Music is one of the earliest forms of communications known to life and has the power to invoke emotions within creatures. Music can set the tone of a day or completely rewire a perspective of a situation. Music plays a role in self discovery, exploration, and enlightenment.</p>

           <p>From my personal experience, I discovered that:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>Music can relieve stress and allievate symptoms of depression</li>
               <li><Strong>Music can allievate traumatic experiences.</Strong> In some cases, a song can be used as a vessel for a traumatic/hurtful experience. (This could be a double edge sword though.) </li>
               <li>Music can dramatically reduce anxiety</li>
           </ul> 
           <p>Throughout my childhood, music was the only medium that allowed me to get lost in my work. Even during my hardtimes, Music allowed me to completely distant myself from whatever situation I didn't want to find myself in. Music is powerful and not in a cliche way. I'd even bet that its the language of aliens.</p>
